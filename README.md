Anime information website - Nodejs back - React front

#

The purpose of this website is 100% personal. I'm working on it on my spare time, and my goal is to be able to use my own anime information website rather than the common ones (MyAnimeList, ...). It also allows me to learn a lot about NodeJS and React, in addition to the courses I had.

I'm only using it for test purposes for the moment, so we are very far from the final result, and how I want it to look like.
